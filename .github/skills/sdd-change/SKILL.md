Mandatory entrypoint: every new natural-language development request is a new change, even in an existing Copilot session; never reuse prior requirements, approvals, TDD, or change evidence unless the user explicitly names the existing change ID and asks to continue it. never start implementation before validating requirements/design; skip only for verified approved artifacts of that explicitly continued change.
Never infer approval; show `approval prepare <stage>` and record only its reviewed hash with `approval record <stage> --approver <name> --artifact-sha256 <hash> --confirm`.
Whenever an AI deliverable is documentation (requirements, design, ADRs, the CHANGE document, or release/quality evidence), run Copilot's native `rubber-duck` review agent on it before that phase's human approval, fixing every issue and re-reviewing until none remain.
Follow the user's input language. Use native Copilot planning, editing, research, review, security review and subagents.
Record exactly one final invocation outcome with `npx musubix3 workflow-record sdd-change complete --status <status>`; `change-record` separately proves phases.
Run `workflow-sanitize <copilot.jsonl> <safe.jsonl>` before review, then
`workflow-verify <safe.jsonl>`; it validates source-order lifecycles without
assuming globally monotonic clocks unless `maxEventSkewMs` is explicitly set.
Baseline-protect transcript byte limits; never truncate/edit to bypass them.
For strict evidence, bind an expected UUID; GitHub origin needs strict OIDC.
Never record multiple declarations per invocation; use only the configured CLI.
For broad work, use short stages: initialize, requirements, requirements approval, design, design approval, real Red, Green, integration, trace/formal, quality, release approval. Report each result before the next prompt.
For a staged change, run `change-record <CHANGE-ID> <phase> --requirement <REQ-ID...>` after each phase in this exact order: `impact`, `requirements`, `design`, `red`, `implementation`, `green`, `quality`.
`impact`/`requirements`/`design`/`quality` always use the full requirement ID set; `red`/`implementation`/`green` may instead use a non-empty subset as an independent per-requirement batch for an interleaved Red-Implementation-Green loop; `quality` still needs full cumulative Green coverage.
List only requirements whose statement/acceptance changes, classify each, and
document other impacts separately. Each needs fresh Red and Green.
The CHANGE document must contain `Requirements:` with exactly those normative IDs.
Persisted monotonic order, not wall-clock time, proves these phase boundaries.
## 1. Classify and inspect / 分類と事前確認
1. Classify the request as a feature, behavior change, defect correction,
   refactoring, or documentation-only change. For a new program/feature, create
   a fresh feature slug and CHANGE artifact; prior session context is not approval.
2. Read the constitution and relevant requirements, designs, ADRs, code and tests, but treat prior-session artifacts as historical context unless continuation is explicit.
3. Run `trace impact`; when code exists run `graph index` and `graph impact`.
4. Separate confirmed intent, assumptions and open questions. When material context is missing, ask exactly one highest-priority question, wait, then repeat; never batch questions or finalize requirements, design or code while blockers remain.
## 2. Update specifications first / 仕様を先に更新
1. For new or changed observable behavior, add or revise EARS requirements and
   measurable acceptance criteria before implementation. Preserve stable IDs
   when meaning remains the same; create new IDs when obligations are distinct.
2. For a bug where implementation violates an existing requirement, keep that
   requirement and record that no specification change is needed. Never rewrite
   a requirement merely to make incorrect behavior appear compliant.
3. Run requirements and constitution validation; stop on invalid artifacts
   instead of continuing with unapproved assumptions.
4. Run a `rubber-duck` review (Copilot's native review agent) of `requirements.md`, fixing every issue and re-reviewing until none remain, then stop for explicit current `requirements` approval before design. An edit to `requirements.md` re-opens approval and requires re-review.
5. Update design responsibilities/interfaces/constraints/links and ADRs, run design validation, then run the same rubber-duck review/fix loop on `design.md`/ADRs before stopping for explicit current `design` approval before Red/implementation. An edit re-opens approval and requires re-review.
## 3. Implement and prove coverage / 実装と網羅性
1. For observable behavior changes and defect fixes, write the smallest meaningful
   test first. Include its `TEST-*` ID in the test name/output and link it to the
   requirement with `@verifies`. Configure the command's `tddArgs` with
   `{testId}` or `{testPath}` so only that test is selected. Configure
   `tddReport` and make the runner write a fresh `musubix-json` result containing
   exactly the target test with `failed` or `passed` status, or select a built-in
   test adapter. For deterministic performance requirements, use a passing
   instrumented `operations` report with command/report/run/exit provenance;
   native adapters cannot emit app counters, and elapsed time is insufficient.
2. Run `npx musubix3 tdd red <TEST-ID> --requirement <REQ-ID> --command <name>`.
   Do not edit implementation code until this records the expected failing test.
3. Implement the smallest complete change, preserving the test, then run
   `tdd green` with the same IDs and command. Refactor only after Green and record
   `tdd refactor` after the refactored code passes.
4. Maintain unique IDs and trace annotations in authoritative files; never add
   proxies for coverage. Links locate evidence, not proof.
5. Run focused tests, then configured typecheck, build and complete test commands.
Documentation/prototypes may omit TDD only when policy allows; record the reason.
## 4. Rebuild evidence and finish / 根拠更新と完了
1. Run `trace build`, `trace check --strict`, `graph index`, and `graph gate`.
2. Run `formal check` when changed requirements fit its documented abstraction;
   use strict `Formal:` JSON for explicit conditional, numeric, temporal or
   transition semantics; report unsupported prose rather than claiming proof.
   A required `formal` check enforces modeled fraction and configured solver.
3. Run `gate --changed --json` and `status --json`. Repair failures, dangling links and stale evidence; never weaken requirements or policy to obtain green. If `workflow` fails, run `workflow-verify` compatible mode against this session's live transcript, then `workflow waiver record-all` (bulk, all-or-nothing) for remaining declaration-scoped diagnostics (it cannot clear `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_UNVERIFIED`), then rerun gate/status.
4. Treat the first otherwise-passing gate as the release candidate. Run a `rubber-duck` review of the release/quality evidence summary and the CHANGE document; fix every reported issue and re-review until zero issues remain. Before any release operation, prepare/show its exact hash, ask one human approve/reject question and wait; record only that hash, then rerun gate/status.
5. Complete only when required checks pass and `status.gate.ready` is true;
   otherwise report blockers. One-phase work must state downstream work.
