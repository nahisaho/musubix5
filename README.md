[What changed from musubix2 to musubix5 (Japanese)](docs/MUSUBIX2-TO-MUSUBIX3.md)

GitHub Copilot can plan, generate, edit, test, and review software. musubix5
adds repository-local specifications plus deterministic, fail-closed checks
over the evidence required by the repository's configured quality profile:
requirements → constitution → design/ADRs → implementation → traceability →
quality evidence.

Learned from [musubix2](https://github.com/nahisaho/musubix2)'s concepts, rebuilt
cleanly in three workspaces. No artifact compatibility or migration is promised.
This repository does **not** guarantee correctness simply because IDs are linked
or requirements are satisfiable.

## Why GitHub Copilot alone is not enough

Copilot is the implementation engine. It understands a request, explores the
repository, proposes a plan, edits files, runs tools, and explains the result.
That is necessary, but a successful conversation is not durable proof that:

- the implemented behavior matches an explicit, measurable requirement;
- every requirement is connected to design, code, and an authoritative test;
- Red really failed before Green passed without the test being rewritten;
- test, graph, formal, and quality results still match the current source;
- a requirement change propagated through all affected artifacts in order;
- a policy was not weakened merely to make the final gate pass.

Conversation text such as “tests passed” or “implementation complete” is not
enough because it can become stale, omit scope, or disappear outside the
repository. Copilot should remain responsible for reasoning and development;
musubix5 makes the completion criteria persistent and machine-checkable.

| GitHub Copilot provides | musubix5 complements it with |
|---|---|
| Planning, coding, refactoring, and tool execution | Repository-local SDD Skills that require explicit requirements, design decisions, implementation links, and completion conditions |
| Test generation and runner execution | Structured TEST identities, native-report normalization, and verified Red/Green/Refactor evidence |
| Explanations of what changed | Typed requirement → design → code → test traceability and bidirectional impact analysis |
| Repository exploration | Deterministic Code Graph indexing, unresolved-local dependency diagnostics, and architecture gates |
| Suggestions for constraints and invariants | Optional Z3/Lean consistency checks and model-to-passing-test correspondence |
| A session-level completion report | Freshness, fingerprints, input-stability checks, protected policy baselines, attestations, and a fail-closed readiness gate |

musubix5 does **not** replace Copilot, add another coding agent, or claim that
formal satisfiability proves implementation correctness. Copilot performs the
development; musubix5 records the specification, checks the evidence, rejects
stale or incomplete required evidence, and leaves a reviewable answer to “why
does this repository's configured policy consider the change ready?”

## Quick start

There are two ways to load musubix5's skills into a project — pick exactly
one per project, never both:

- **`npm install` (this section, recommended)**: add `musubix5` as a project
  dev dependency, then run `npx musubix5 init` to copy the skills into
  `.github/skills/` and scaffold starter `.musubix/` artifacts. Version and
  upgrades are tracked in your project's `package.json`/lockfile
  (`npm install ...@latest` + `npx musubix5 upgrade`); see
  [Upgrade](#upgrade). Recommended because the skills and starter SDD
  artifacts are committed to the repository itself, so every contributor and
  CI job gets the same reproducible setup without each of them running a
  separate plugin install.
- **`copilot plugin install`** (native plugin/marketplace route): register
  musubix5 directly with Copilot CLI's own plugin manager — no npm
  dependency is added to the project, and no files are copied into
  `.github/skills/`. Upgraded with `copilot plugin update musubix5` (or the
  marketplace equivalent). See
  [Distribution options](#distribution-options) for the exact commands.

The rest of this section documents the npm install route.

For a reproducible project-local installation:

```sh
npm install --save-dev --save-exact musubix5@latest
npx --no-install musubix5 --version
npx --no-install musubix5 init --dry-run
npx --no-install musubix5 init
copilot
```

For a one-time evaluation without pinning subsequent Skill-driven CLI runs:

```sh
npx musubix5@latest --version
npx musubix5@latest init --dry-run
```

Install the exact local dependency before relying on generated Skills in
continued development; their commands intentionally use the repository-local
`npx --no-install musubix5` executable.

To build the repository itself:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nahisaho/musubix5.git
cd musubix5
npm install
npm run build
node dist/packages/cli/src/main.js --help
```

Ask Copilot: “Use sdd-change to add this feature and propagate it through the
specification, implementation, traceability, and quality gate.”
All eight skills instruct Copilot to follow your input language (English/Japanese).

`init` (`install` alias) copies repository-local skills and creates starter SDD
artifacts. It preserves existing files, merges a cache ignore rule, and is
idempotent. `--force` replaces only named bundled/managed paths; it does not
delete unrelated files. Review its dry-run first. No Copilot global settings,
MCP, LSP, hooks, or project instructions are overwritten. Symbolic-link write
targets and paths escaping the project are refused.

The starter is deliberately **not release-ready**: replace its example, implement
and test it, and configure real check commands before expecting the gate to pass.

## Upgrade

`upgrade` is available starting with 0.1.14 (not in 0.1.13 or earlier — check
with `npm view musubix5 versions`).

For the npm-installed route (`init`/repository-local skills):

```sh
npm install --save-dev --save-exact musubix5@latest
npx --no-install musubix5 upgrade --dry-run
npx --no-install musubix5 upgrade
```

`upgrade` refreshes only the bundled `.github/skills/sdd-*` files that differ
from the installed package version. It never creates, replaces, or deletes
`.musubix/config.json`, `.musubix/policy-baseline.json`,
`.musubix/constitution.md`, ADRs, feature artifacts, evidence, or
`.gitignore` — those are yours to keep customizing. It is idempotent: it
compares against the currently installed package's skill files, so running it
again without first installing a newer `musubix5` version reports every skill
file as `unchanged`. Review `--dry-run` first, same as `init`.

`init --force` remains available for replacing bundled/managed paths more
broadly (including `.musubix/config.json`, `constitution.md`, and the
starter feature's `requirements.md`/`design.md`), but it overwrites
customized content in those files, so prefer `upgrade` for routine version
bumps.

For the native plugin route:

```sh
copilot plugin update musubix5
```

For the native marketplace route:

```sh
copilot plugin marketplace update musubix5-marketplace
copilot plugin update musubix5
```

These delegate to Copilot's own plugin manager, which re-fetches
`plugin.json`/the marketplace catalog; they do not touch `.musubix/` at all
(only the npm-installed route manages `.musubix/` artifacts).

## Distribution options

Choose one skill-loading route to avoid duplicate skill names.

### Native plugin (direct)

Pick exactly one of the following (not both):

```sh
copilot plugin install ./musubix5            # local clone, from its parent directory
```

```sh
copilot plugin install nahisaho/musubix5     # published GitHub repository, no local clone needed
```

`plugin.json` at the repository root is the source of truth and references
`.github/skills/`. The plugin contains skills, not an agent runtime or background
services. Git installs do not compile/install the npm engine: build the clone or
install the npm package separately when running `npx musubix5` commands.

There is a third way to run the same `copilot plugin install`, useful only if
you want a durable local path instead of an ephemeral npx cache — do this
**instead of**, not in addition to, the two commands above:

```sh
npm install --save-dev --save-exact musubix5@latest
npx --no-install musubix5 plugin-install
```

`plugin-install` only calls `copilot plugin install <absolute-package-root>`
for you; it does not edit Copilot internals, and it is unrelated to the
npm-installed skill-copy route in [Quick start](#quick-start) — it never runs
`init` and never copies files into `.github/skills/`. Do not run both this and
`npx musubix5 init` in the same project.

### Native marketplace

```sh
copilot plugin marketplace add nahisaho/musubix5
copilot plugin install musubix5@musubix5-marketplace
# Local development:
copilot plugin marketplace add ./musubix5
```

The catalog is `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`; its plugin source is `.`.
These flows use the [native plugin interface](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference).

### Repository-local skills / npm installer

Run `npx --no-install musubix5 init` after installing the exact local dependency,
or copy `.github/skills/sdd-*` there yourself. Start Copilot in that trusted project.
`init --root <dir>` targets
another project; `--feature <slug>` changes the starter directory and ID prefix.
Installing another feature does not reset existing configuration.

## Skills and native boundaries

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sdd-change` | End-to-end feature/change/fix propagation and completion gate |
| `sdd-requirements` | Six controlled EARS forms and measurable constitution |
| `sdd-design` | Explicit responsibilities/interfaces/constraints, ADRs, diagrams |
| `sdd-implementation` | Native editing with requirement-linked code and tests |
| `sdd-traceability` | Generated coverage, dangling links, bidirectional impact |
| `sdd-quality` | Actual verification commands, policy, readiness evidence |
| `sdd-knowledge` | Local artifact/Git retrieval, not conversational memory |
| `sdd-formal-codegraph` | Optional consistency checks, compiler graph, architecture |

Use **native Copilot** for planning, editing, research, review, security review,
memory, code navigation/LSP, MCP management, and subagent/fleet/task coordination.
musubix5 does not implement those services, generic code/test generation,
orchestration, a scheduler, MCP server, Claude support, an interactive REPL, or a
resident watcher. `status`, `query`, `impact` and `--changed` provide one-shot value.
Skills may combine neural proposals from Copilot with symbolic checks; there is
no separate “neurosymbolic AI” model or claims of learned verification.

## Workflow

Natural-language requests such as “develop/build/create/implement X” activate
`sdd-change` as the mandatory first Skill. It elicits and validates requirements
and design before implementation; only an explicit request to implement existing
approved artifacts may enter `sdd-implementation` directly. The implementation
Skill fails closed when those validated artifacts are absent or invalid. When
material context is missing, requirements elicitation asks one highest-priority
question at a time and waits for the answer; it does not batch questions or
finalize requirements while blockers remain.

1. Use native planning/research to establish intent and measurable acceptance.
2. Record `change-record CHANGE-ID impact`, edit/validate requirements, run a
   `rubber-duck` review of the requirements document and fix every finding
   (repeat review/fix until zero issues remain), record the `requirements`
   checkpoint, then obtain explicit artifact-bound human `requirements`
   approval before design.
3. Design explicit components, record trade-offs in ADRs, run a `rubber-duck`
   review of the design document/ADRs and fix every finding (repeat until zero
   issues remain), record `design`, then obtain explicit artifact-bound human
   `design` approval before implementation.
4. Write an annotated behavior test, record a structured failing `tdd red`, then
   record the change `red` checkpoint.
5. Implement the minimum change, record `implementation`, run passing `tdd green`,
   then record `green` and refactor. For a change with multiple requirements,
   `red`/`implementation`/`green` may instead be recorded once per requirement
   subset (an independent batch per subset), completing each requirement's
   Red-Implementation-Green loop before moving to the next, instead of
   completing every requirement's Red before any Implementation.
6. Add trace annotations, build graphs, inspect impact and fix missing coverage.
7. Configure real checks and run the candidate `gate --changed`. Run a
   `rubber-duck` review of the release/quality evidence summary and fix every
   finding (repeat until zero issues remain). After every required
   non-approval check passes, obtain explicit human `release` approval,
   rerun the gate/status, and only then commit, push, publish, or deploy.

Any AI-generated documentation deliverable (requirements, design, ADRs, the
CHANGE document, or release/quality evidence summaries) goes through this
`rubber-duck` review/fix loop until zero issues remain **before** the
corresponding human approval step is requested.

```sh
npx musubix5 requirements validate .musubix/features/example/requirements.md --json

npx musubix5 approval prepare design --json
npx musubix5 approval record design --approver "Design Owner" --artifact-sha256 "$REVIEWED_HASH" --confirm
npx musubix5 change-record CHANGE-0001 design --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001
npx musubix5 tdd red TEST-EXAMPLE-001 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001 --command test

npx musubix5 tdd green TEST-EXAMPLE-001 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001 --command test
npx musubix5 tdd refactor TEST-EXAMPLE-001 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001 --command test
# A change declaring REQ-EXAMPLE-001 and REQ-EXAMPLE-002 may record red/implementation/green
# once per requirement subset instead of once for the whole change:
npx musubix5 change-record CHANGE-0001 red --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001
npx musubix5 change-record CHANGE-0001 implementation --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001
npx musubix5 change-record CHANGE-0001 green --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-001
npx musubix5 trace build
npx musubix5 trace check --strict --json
npx musubix5 graph index
npx musubix5 graph impact src/service.ts
npx musubix5 gate --changed --json
npx musubix5 approval prepare release --json
npx musubix5 approval record release --approver "Release Owner" --artifact-sha256 "$REVIEWED_HASH" --confirm
npx musubix5 gate --changed --json
npx musubix5 approval validate --json
npx musubix5 status --json
```

### A requirement already satisfied as a side effect

`tdd red` rejects recording a Red phase for a test that is already passing
(`TDD_TARGET_RESULT`). This is correct: it is not a bug when a correct,
general implementation written for one requirement also happens to satisfy a
separate, not-yet-implemented requirement (for example, a general
capacity-aware assignment algorithm that also correctly handles a "no
resource available" edge case required by a different requirement). There is
deliberately no `--already-satisfied-by`-style declaration to bypass Red for
this case: a human declaration that a requirement is "already satisfied
elsewhere" is not measured evidence, and accepting one would let an
unimplemented or incorrectly implemented requirement pass gate on an
unverified claim.

The recommended practice is to prove the Red genuinely, the same way as any
other requirement, by briefly and deliberately narrowing the scope of the
already-correct shared implementation so the new requirement's test fails,
recording `tdd red`, then restoring the correct implementation for `tdd
green`:

```sh
# The shared implementation is already correct; temporarily narrow it
# (e.g. re-add the special case the general algorithm already subsumes)
# so TEST-EXAMPLE-002 genuinely fails.
npx musubix5 tdd red TEST-EXAMPLE-002 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-002 --command test
# Restore the correct (already-written) implementation; no other code changes.
npx musubix5 tdd green TEST-EXAMPLE-002 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-002 --command test
```

Keep the narrowing edit local and revert it in the same step as recording
Green; do not leave the weakened code committed at any point.

### A brand-new module for a from-scratch requirement

`tdd red` requires a *collected and executed* failing test, not merely a test
file that exists: if the test imports a source module that does not exist
yet, the runner fails at collection time (0 tests run) instead of failing an
assertion, and `tdd red` correctly reports this as an invalid Red
(`TDD_REPORT_INVALID`). For a vitest/jest adapter, the thrown error now
appends the underlying suite collection-failure message (for example
`Cannot find module '../src/service.js'`) after `No annotated TEST-*
identities were found`, to make this cause visible immediately instead of
requiring a separate investigation.

The recommended practice for a genuinely new module is the same
stub-then-correct technique as above: create a compiling implementation file
with a deliberately wrong body first, so the runner can collect and execute
the test (and it fails on the wrong behavior, not on a missing import), then
implement the correct behavior for Green:

```sh
# src/service.ts does not exist yet; create it with an intentionally wrong body
# so the test can be collected and genuinely fails on assertion, not on import.
npx musubix5 tdd red TEST-EXAMPLE-003 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-003 --command test
# Replace the stub body with the correct implementation.
npx musubix5 tdd green TEST-EXAMPLE-003 --requirement REQ-EXAMPLE-003 --command test
```

## Command reference

All analysis commands accept `--root <directory>` and `--json`. Files resolve
relative to that root; access outside it is refused. `plugin-install` uses the
installed package root. Exit codes: **0** successful operation, **1** rejected
validation/gate or requested solver failure, **2** usage, I/O or malformed config.
`status` is informational (exit 0 even if not ready); inspect `gate.ready`.

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `init [--dry-run] [--force] [--feature slug]` | Preserve-first skills/artifacts installation; `install` alias |
| `upgrade [--dry-run]` | Refresh bundled skill files only; never touches config, constitution, or feature artifacts |
| `plugin-install` | Invoke native Copilot installer (no internal config edits) |
| `requirements validate <file>` | IDs, priorities, declared/detected EARS pattern |
| `requirements scaffold <slug> [--title <text>]` | Create `.musubix/features/<slug>/requirements.md` from a fixed placeholder template; never overwrites an existing file |
| `constitution validate [file]` | Versioned principles and measurable rule definitions |
| `design validate <file>` | Fields, global requirement IDs, existing ADR references |
| `design scaffold <slug>` | Create `.musubix/features/<slug>/design.md` from a fixed placeholder template; never overwrites an existing file, and does not require a pre-existing `requirements.md` |
| `design c4 <file>` | Mermaid component/dependency diagram from explicit fields |
| `approval prepare <requirements\|design\|release>` | Display the exact deterministic manifest and hash for human review |
| `approval record <stage> --approver <name> --artifact-sha256 <hash> --confirm` | Record approval only if the reviewed hash is still current |
| `approval validate` | Report each approval as approved, missing, or stale; never infer approval from validation |
| `trace build` | Generate global trace snapshot and feature copies |
| `trace check [--strict]` | Dangling IDs, stale inputs/paths, mandatory coverage |
| `trace impact <id-or-path>` | Bidirectional breadth-first traversal with explanation paths |
| `graph index [--changed]` | Compiler imports, declarations and best-effort call targets |
| `graph impact <symbol-or-path>` | Conservative reverse-import closure; `path#name` disambiguates |
| `graph cycles` | Strongly connected components; exit 1 when cycles exist |
| `graph gate` | Fresh index + architecture rule/cycle checks |
| `knowledge build` | Markdown and bounded Git evidence index |
| `knowledge query <text> [--limit 10]` | Deterministic TF-IDF/cosine results and staleness flag |
| `formal generate <file> [--format both\|smt2\|lean]` | Reproducible solver inputs with SHA-256 evidence |
| `formal doctor` | Probe Z3, Lean, and `lake env lean` availability and versions |
| `mutation doctor` | Probe language-aware local mutation engines and show setup recommendations |
| `formal check <file> [--solver auto\|none\|z3\|lean]` | Check the explicit Boolean/conditional/numeric/temporal/transition model |
| `model-correspondence validate` | Revalidate Formal JSON → generated trace → authoritative passing test evidence (run `evidence refresh` first to generate its evidence file) |
| `evidence refresh [--changed]` | Regenerate derived evidence through the same fail-closed gate pipeline |
| `mutation validate` | Revalidate requirement-scoped schema-v1 killed-mutant evidence |
| `mutation identity <REQ-ID> <TEST-ID> <sourcePath> <operator> <line> <column>` | Print the deterministic `MUT-*` identity a mutation report must declare |
| `tdd validate` | Validate persisted Red/Green/Refactor order, fingerprints, durations, and hash-chain evidence |
| `tdd red\|green\|refactor <TEST-ID> --requirement <REQ-ID> --command <name>` | Execute and record a verified TDD phase. Recording the project's **first** `tdd` cycle (any `red` call while `.musubix/evidence/tdd.json` has zero cycles) makes `gate`'s `tdd` check required **project-wide**, for every mandatory requirement, not just the ones touched by the current change; each uncovered requirement then surfaces as `TDD_REQUIREMENT_UNCOVERED`. `approval record release` always runs the full (non-`--changed`) gate, so it is blocked by any resulting `TDD_REQUIREMENT_UNCOVERED` diagnostics. `tdd migrate` cannot be used to bulk-onboard previously-uncovered requirements: it only re-fingerprints a requirement that already has a valid Green cycle. `tdd red` prints/returns a `TDD_ADOPTION_PROJECT_WIDE` warning (in a `warnings` array, separate from `diagnostics`) the moment this first cycle is persisted, listing every other still-uncovered mandatory requirement. |
| `workflow-record <skill> <phase> --status <status>` | Record a compact self-reported workflow declaration |
| `workflow waiver record <code> --skill <skill> --phase <phase> --recorded-at <timestamp> [--index <n>] --approver <name> --reason <text> --confirm` | Record an audited, bounded downgrade of one declaration-scoped workflow reconciliation diagnostic (`WORKFLOW_SKILL_NOT_INVOKED`, `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_ORDER`, `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_INCOMPLETE`, `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_FAILED`, or `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_REUSED`) to a non-blocking waived status; a paired `WORKFLOW_BINDING_MISSING` diagnostic sharing the same declaration scope is downgraded together with it. It cannot waive `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_UNVERIFIED`, which only `workflow-verify` having actually run this session can resolve |
| `workflow waiver record-all --approver <name> --reason <text> --confirm` | Bulk variant of `workflow waiver record`: waives every currently-outstanding waivable declaration-scoped diagnostic across the whole reconciliation report in one all-or-nothing call, instead of one `record` invocation per diagnostic. Rejects (recording nothing) if any bulk waiver precondition fails first — malformed waiver evidence, an invalid waiver chain, a blank `--approver`/`--reason`, or a `WORKFLOW_INVOCATION_UNVERIFIED` diagnostic (which `workflow-verify` must resolve first; no per-declaration or bulk waiver can substitute for `workflow-verify` never having run). Each waived declaration-scoped diagnostic's paired `WORKFLOW_BINDING_MISSING` is downgraded together with it, identically to the existing single-record command. With zero remaining candidates (already waived, or none present) it succeeds idempotently and records nothing |
| `workflow-sanitize <copilot.jsonl> <output-file> [--session-id <uuid>]` | Remove messages and non-Skill tool data before review or strict verification |
| `workflow-verify <copilot.jsonl...> [--strict] [--session-id <uuid>]` | Reconcile Skill events; compatible mode accepts multiple transcript files (concatenated in chronological session order) so declarations whose invocation occurred in an earlier Copilot CLI session can be reconciled; `--strict`/`--session-id` still require exactly one file |
| `attestation oidc-audience --key-id <id> [--public-key-file <pem>]` | Derive the GitHub custom audience that authorizes a signing key |
| `attestation payload --provider <name> --run-id <id> --key-id <id> [--public-key-file <pem>] [--github-oidc-token-file <jwt>]` | Emit canonical unsigned CI payload for external signing |
| `attestation verify` | Verify static-key or GitHub OIDC-authorized Ed25519 provenance |
| `change-record <CHANGE-ID> <phase> --requirement <REQ-ID...> [--allow-unchanged] [--dry-run]` | Record ordered artifact/TDD fingerprints for a staged change. `impact`/`requirements`/`design`/`quality` require the change's full requirement ID set; `red`/`implementation`/`green` also accept a proper non-empty subset, recorded as an independent per-requirement batch, so a multi-requirement change can be completed with an interleaved per-requirement Red-Implementation-Green loop instead of one global batch. Rejects with a non-zero exit and a stable `*_UNCHANGED_AT_RECORD` diagnostic (leaving `changes.json`/`order.json` untouched) when a phase's fingerprint is byte-identical to the immediately preceding phase's, since that mistake is otherwise only caught much later by `trace check --strict`/`gate`, at which point the append-only evidence store makes it unfixable. `--allow-unchanged` bypasses this check for the `requirements` phase only (the one case `sdd-change` documents as legitimate: a defect fix that intentionally leaves its requirement unchanged) and persists a durable marker so later validation does not re-flag it. `--dry-run` previews the exact success/rejection outcome, including every existing check, without persisting anything. Each recorded phase/batch stores both `order` (the verified, `gate`-checked logical append sequence from `order.json` — the only field guaranteed correct and monotonic per change) and `recordedAt` (an independently captured wall-clock timestamp with no ordering guarantee relative to `order`); `gate` reports a non-blocking `CHANGE_RECORDEDAT_OUT_OF_ORDER` warning when a change's `recordedAt` values disagree with its `order` sequence |
| `config lint` | Report configured commands whose `args` reference repository-relative paths that do not exist |
| `config scaffold` | Propose native test-command entries for detected Go/Rust/Maven/Python/Node toolchains without writing `.musubix/config.json` |
| `gate [--changed] [--feature <name>]` | Fresh full checks plus actual configured commands; persist evidence. `--feature` scopes requirements/design/trace/tdd/change-history/change-completeness checks to one feature as a diagnostic view; never a substitute for the repository-wide gate |
| `status` | Artifact counts and readiness/staleness summary |

`--changed` reads staged, unstaged, untracked and renamed/deleted paths from Git.
It reports affected files but **conservatively recomputes all deterministic checks
and executes all configured commands**. This avoids unsafe incremental skips.
There is no daemon, polling loop or background service.
Workflow evidence automatically requires `workflow`. TDD evidence automatically
requires `tdd`; a `.musubix/changes/CHANGE-*.md` document additionally requires
`tdd`, `change-history`, and `change-completeness`, even when omitted from
`requiredChecks`.

### Requirements and design

```markdown
---
schemaVersion: 1
feature: auth
---
## REQ-AUTH-001: Reject expired sessions
Priority: must
Type: functional
Pattern: event-driven
Statement: When a session expires, the system shall reject the request.
Acceptance: An expired-session request produces HTTP 401.
Formal: {"kind":"conditional","condition":"session.expired","consequence":"request.rejected"}

## DES-AUTH-001: Session guard
Responsibilities: Reject requests whose session has expired.
Interfaces: guard(request) returns a principal or HTTP 401.
Constraints: Do not log session tokens.
Requirements: REQ-AUTH-001
ADRs: ADR-0001
Depends-On: DES-AUTH-002
```

Put these entries in their respective `requirements.md` / `design.md`; declare
every dependency as another component. A component that genuinely has no
architecturally significant decision may write `ADRs: none — <reason>` (a
concrete, non-placeholder reason) instead of a real ADR reference; a bare
`none`, an empty field, or a placeholder reason (`TODO`/`TBD`/`N/A`/`未定`)
still fails validation, now with `DES_ADR_EXEMPTION_REASON` when a "none"
marker is present without a usable reason. Each requirement has one controlled
statement. Accepted priorities are `must` (default), `should`, `may`.
Requirement types are `functional` (default) and `non-functional`.
`Formal:` is optional strict single-line JSON. Supported kinds are `conditional`,
`numeric` (integer comparison), `temporal` (`withinMs` plus optional nonnegative
`afterMs`), and `transition` (`from`/`event`/`to`). Numeric units `ms`/`s`/`min`
share an exact duration dimension, while `bytes`/`kib`/`mib` share an exact size
dimension. Other units and incompatible dimensions remain separate. It models
only the declared fields. A non-functional
requirement may also declare
`Performance: {"counter":"visitedNodes","max":100,"testId":"TEST-AUTH-002"}`;
the named passing test must report that integer operation counter.
IDs use uppercase `REQ-`, `DES-`, `CODE-`, `TEST-`, a feature prefix, and ≥3 digits.
ADRs use `ADR-` plus ≥4 digits. IDs must be globally unique.

Six EARS patterns: “The system shall …”; “When …, the system shall …”;
“While …, …”; “If …, then …”; “Where …, …”; combined distinct
Where/While/When clauses. Japanese controlled forms are documented in
[README-ja.md](README-ja.md). These are syntax checks, not natural-language
understanding; arbitrary prose is deliberately rejected.

Source/test trace annotations are read from language comments. JS/TS uses
parser-aware comment locations; Haskell supports `--` and `{- ... -}`, Lua
supports `--` and `--[[ ... ]]`, and Visual Basic supports apostrophe comments
including `'''` XML documentation. These scanners exclude string literals;
other languages require their supported line or block comments. Python annotations
must use consecutive `#` comments; annotation-like text in docstrings is ignored
with `TRACE_ANNOTATION_IN_PYTHON_DOCSTRING` guidance:

```ts
/** @id CODE-AUTH-001
 * @implements REQ-AUTH-001
 * @design DES-AUTH-001
 */
export function guard() { /* actual implementation */ }

/** @id TEST-AUTH-001
 * @verifies REQ-AUTH-001
 */
// Real behavior test follows.
```

One block comment per entity; comma/space-separated targets. `@design` is optional.
**This doc comment and native test-report ID matching are two independent
requirements that must both be satisfied for `tdd red`/`tdd green` to succeed.**
The `@id TEST-*`/`@verifies REQ-*` comment only makes the test discoverable as a
`kind: 'test'` trace-graph node, so the CLI can resolve its requirement link.
Separately, the configured adapter (or `tddReport`) must match that same ID
inside the *executed* native test report, using its own adapter-specific
mechanism — see the adapter reference table below. A test with only the doc
comment but a report the adapter cannot match to that ID fails Red/Green
(the report never contains a recognized `TEST-*` entry); a test whose report
matches but lacks the doc comment fails earlier with `Annotated test ID not
found: <id>` (not present in the trace graph). Both failure modes look similar
but have different causes — check the doc comment first, then the adapter's
matching rule below.
In PHP, use plain `/* ... */` blocks rather than `/** ... */` PHPDoc: PHPDoc reserves
`@implements` for generic type declarations, so PHPStan/Psalm report `phpDoc.parseError`
on requirement-ID lists inside doc comments. musubix5 reads either form.
Mandatory implementation coverage may be direct or through a linked design;
tests must directly verify a requirement. Links alone are not semantic proof.
Each feature's `trace.json` holds the complete repository snapshot, including
cross-feature edges and input SHA-256 fingerprints; copies intentionally agree.
The cache is preferred when present; feature snapshots support cache-free checks.
Rebuild when inputs change; stale impact queries are rejected.

### Constitution and configuration

```markdown
---
version: 1.0.0
---
## PRINC-001: Evidence first
### RULE-001: No missing trace coverage
Metric: trace.errors
Limit: 0
```

Supported metrics are `requirements.errors`, `design.errors`, `trace.errors`,
`graph.violations`, `formal.errors`, `formal.modeledFraction`,
`tests.annotatedIds`, `tests.executedIds`, `commands.failures` and
`commands.skipped`. Every rule declares a nonnegative numeric upper bound.
`constitution validate` checks the definition; only `gate` measures it.
Unavailable evidence is skipped, never a measured zero.

Example `.musubix/config.json` (adapt command arguments to your own project):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "language": "auto",
  "qualityProfile": "custom",
  "commands": [

    ]
  }
}
```

Config is validated strictly; misspelled keys, invalid bounds and duplicate
commands fail closed. Globs support `*`, `**`, `?`; external imports use `npm:`.
A command may declare an optional `cwd` (a project-root-relative directory)
so it runs from a service subdirectory instead of the project root — useful
for a polyglot monorepo where a language's tooling expects to run from its
own package/module directory. `config lint` reports `CONFIG_CWD_INVALID` for
a `cwd` that escapes the project root or does not exist, and checks that
command's repository-relative path arguments (`CONFIG_ORPHANED_PATH`)
against its own `cwd` instead of the project root. Evidence and report paths
(`tddReport`/`testReport`/`mutationReport`, `.musubix/config.json` itself)
are always resolved from the project root regardless of `cwd`; only the
spawned process's own working directory changes.
`qualityProfile` is `custom` by default. `minimal` preserves the core SDD gate,
`recommended` also requires strict Code Graph, TDD and structured test
identities, and `release` requires the complete formal, mutation, workflow,
change, performance and CI-attestation checks. Stronger profiles reject missing
or weakened settings rather than silently filling in evidence.
`approval.mode` is `required` in newly initialized projects and requires current
requirements, design, and release approvals. Existing schema-v1 configs that
omit `approval` load in `compatible` mode. Approval files store the stage,
approver, `approvedAt`, per-artifact SHA-256 values, and a deterministic manifest
SHA-256. Run `approval prepare` before review and pass that exact hash to
`approval record`; an intervening change is rejected and later changes become
stale. Release recording recomputes the gate and requires every required
non-approval check to pass rather than trusting cached quality evidence.
The approver string is explicit local evidence, not authenticated identity;
repositories that require independent identity must also use protected review,
CODEOWNERS, or CI/OIDC controls.
Local approval evidence records explicit intent but does not cryptographically
authenticate the approver; protect release authorization with repository review,
CODEOWNERS/branch protection, or CI/OIDC attestation.
Candidate release approval additionally requires the closed GitHub Actions
matrix in `.github/workflows/candidate-gate.yml`. Prepare its bound inputs with
`musubix5 candidate-gate context`, dispatch the workflow for the exact candidate,
download all five opaque artifacts, ingest them with
`musubix5 candidate-gate ingest <artifact...>`, and verify the set with
`musubix5 candidate-gate validate`. Ingestion rejects unsigned, stale, wrong-candidate, same-batch duplicate-job,
or reused-run artifacts; validation rejects any accepted record whose gate
reported a tracked-tree change.
Dispatch with a branch or tag ref whose tip is exactly the candidate commit;
the verified `workflow_sha` claim is required to match that commit. Moving the
ref after candidate selection requires a new candidate or restoring an
authorized immutable ref before rerunning the workflow.
Use `tdd.redPreflightCommands` to reference plain configured formatter commands;
they must pass before Red captures the authoritative test fingerprint.
Conventional `.venv` and `venv` Python environments containing a regular
`pyvenv.cfg`, plus generated `__pycache__/` directories, are excluded from
source snapshots and Code Graph indexing. Standalone `.pyc`/`.pyo` files remain
tracked because Python can execute source-less bytecode modules.
Gradle `.gradle/`, Dart `.dart_tool/`, SwiftPM `.build/`, Zig
`.zig-cache/`/`zig-out/`, and .NET `.dotnet/` CLI homes are excluded only when
their parent contains the corresponding project manifest. Arbitrary same-named
source directories remain tracked.
`codeGraph.mode` defaults to `compatible`, where unresolved computed
`import()`/`require()` calls remain warnings. Set it to `strict` to make those
diagnostics gate-blocking errors. A trusted strict policy baseline prevents
downgrading the project back to compatible mode.
Coverage bounds are fractions [0,1] of mandatory requirements. Bare `trace check
--strict` always requires full coverage; the aggregate gate uses config thresholds.
The reported value is **link coverage**, not proof; with zero mandatory
requirements it is `null` (not applicable). Add `test-identities` to
`requiredChecks` to require every annotated `TEST-*` ID to be reported `passed`
by a fresh structured report from a successful configured command.
Add `formal` to enforce the configured solver and minimum modeled fraction.
Every requirement containing explicit `Formal:` JSON automatically requires
`model-correspondence`: its current formal constraint and generated trace must
lead to at least one authoritative `TEST-*` that passed in a fresh structured
command report. Missing, changed, unlinked, or stale evidence fails closed.
`.musubix/evidence/model-correspondence.json` is only produced by
`evidence refresh`; running `model-correspondence validate` before that file
exists fails with `MODEL_CORRESPONDENCE_MISSING`, whose message and the
command's own `--help` output both name `evidence refresh` as the fix.
Add `tdd` to require complete Red-Green cycles. Red must be an observed nonzero
test result; Green/Refactor must pass with the same configured command and
unchanged test file. Test names/output must contain their `TEST-*` ID.
`language` records project preference; skills follow input language. Machine
diagnostic codes are stable English; human status labels include Japanese.

`.musubix/policy-baseline.json` records minimum required checks, coverage,
architecture, formal policy, mutation and approval modes, workflow strict/session/freshness settings,
CI-required attestation and strict OIDC identity/key binding, and required
command names. A baseline that requires TDD Red preflights must also include
their normalized `commands` definitions, which prevents replacing a trusted
formatter while retaining its name. Weakening is rejected; changing the baseline in `gate --changed`
requires independent approval. Protect the baseline with review/CODEOWNERS.

**Only run trusted configuration**: gates execute its commands with inherited
environment, no shell interpretation and bounded time/output. Required command
failure or skip blocks readiness regardless of `requiredChecks.commands`.
A structured test command also fails if it reports no executed tests or any
skipped, failed, or errored test, even when its process exits zero; this prevents integration suites
from silently passing without their dependencies. Optional command failures are
nonblocking unless a constitution rule rejects the measured count. No configured
commands is skipped, not passed.
**Adapter test-ID declaration reference** (each mechanism is distinct; see the
dual-requirement note above for how this relates to the `@id`/`@verifies` doc
comment):

| Adapter | ID-declaration mechanism | Worked example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vitest` / `jest` | ID as a substring anywhere in the test title | `it('TEST-APP-001 rejects empty input', () => { ... })` |
| `pytest` | ID in the underscore-form test function name | `def test_TEST_APP_001(): ...` |
| `go-test` | ID as the trailing suffix of the test/subtest name | `func TestTEST_APP_001(t *testing.T) { ... }` |
| `cargo` | ID as the trailing suffix of a Rust test identifier | `fn test_app_001() { ... }` |
| `junit` | Exact `@Tag("TEST-APP-001")` **plus** an ID-bearing method name or `@DisplayName` | `@Tag("TEST-APP-001") @Test void test() { ... }` |
| `dotnet` (xUnit) | ID inside `[Fact(DisplayName = "...")]` | `[Fact(DisplayName = "TEST-APP-001 rejects empty input")]` |

`junit` is the only adapter that requires a *separate* tag annotation in
addition to an ID-bearing name/`@DisplayName`; every other adapter matches the
ID directly from the test's own name/title string.

TDD commands require either command-specific `tddArgs` plus a `tddReport`, or a
built-in `vitest`, `jest`, `pytest`, `go-test`, `cargo`, `junit`, or `dotnet` adapter.
The `junit` adapter drives the Java JUnit Platform Console launcher, not arbitrary
JUnit-XML producers; runners such as PHPUnit that only emit JUnit XML need explicit
`tddArgs`/`tddReport` (or `testReport`) configuration instead. A custom
`musubix-json` report is a single-line-safe JSON document
`{"schemaVersion":1,"tests":[{"id":"TEST-APP-001","status":"passed"}]}` where
`status` is `passed`, `failed`, `skipped` or `error`, and an optional
`"operations":{"counter":12}` map carries deterministic performance counters.
Explicit custom configuration takes precedence. Adapters derive targeted
arguments and normalize native JSON/JSONL/XML into `musubix-json`. Vitest/Jest
reports may contain unrelated skipped tests; targeted TDD selects only the
requested ID. pytest requires the JSON-report plugin and underscore-form test
names such as `test_TEST_APP_001`. Go uses a `TEST-*` subtest name, Cargo uses a
Rust identifier such as `test_app_001`. JUnit methods should carry an exact
`@Tag("TEST-APP-001")` and an ID-bearing method name or `@DisplayName`; the
normalizer reads both testcase attributes and JUnit Platform display-name output.
Surefire/Failsafe testcase elements are parsed whether they are self-closing or
carry `<system-out>`/`<system-err>` children, so framework logging such as the
Spring Boot banner does not hide passing identities.
xUnit tests use
`[Fact(DisplayName = "TEST-APP-001 ...")]` so TRX preserves the identity.
Before each phase, musubix5 deletes
the previous report, creates any required report parent directory, and requires a fresh
`musubix-json` document containing exactly the selected test. Its status must be
`failed` during Red and `passed` during Green/Refactor; `skipped`, `error`,
missing and malformed reports fail. A non-test project input must change before
Green. Identical phase output reused by different tests is rejected.
Every phase is also appended to a SHA-256-linked immutable record chain. TDD and
change checkpoints additionally share a persisted monotonic order ledger, which
is authoritative for Red/Green boundaries; wall-clock timestamps are
informational. Legacy chronology without order evidence fails with an explicit
migration diagnostic. Missing, reordered, altered or orphaned records invalidate
the evidence. Superseded cycles are never replaced by a newer recording: if any
cycle lacks test-scoped provenance or a valid Red/Green, move
`.musubix/evidence/tdd.json` aside and re-record every cycle from a clean Red
baseline. There is deliberately no partial prune command, and hand-editing the
evidence is unsupported.

Deterministic mutant identities come from `musubix5 mutation identity
<REQ-ID> <TEST-ID> <sourcePath> <operator> <line> <column>`, which prints the
exact `MUT-*` value a schema-v1 mutation report must declare. `mutation
validate` reads `.musubix/evidence/mutation.json`; a configured `mutationReport`
is converted into that file by the gate, so validating before a gate run reports
absent rather than passing evidence.

CI executes isolated native contracts for Vitest, Jest,
pytest with `pytest-json-report`, Go test, Cargo test, and the pinned JUnit
Platform Console. The .NET adapter consumes standard TRX and is additionally
validated by unit contracts and the C# application experiment. Each fixture contains an unrelated failing test, proving that
the generated selector executes only the requested identity and that the real
native report normalizes correctly. Jest is development-only; the Python,
Go/Rust, and Java/JUnit tooling is provisioned only in CI and is not shipped as
a package runtime dependency.

Change checkpoints fingerprint only implementation files linked to each changed
requirement, plus their Code Graph dependencies. An unrelated source change
cannot satisfy the implementation phase. The automatic `change-completeness`
gate checks each CHANGE-ID for classified functional/non-functional requirements,
measurable Acceptance criteria, concrete design responsibilities/interfaces/
constraints, an existing ADR, linked code, authoritative annotated tests,
bounded TDD and trace edges. Each CHANGE document must contain a `Requirements:`
line enumerating exactly the chronology's normative requirement IDs.

Structured test results may add
`"operations":{"visitedNodes":42}`. A declared deterministic performance budget
automatically requires the `performance` gate; elapsed time alone cannot satisfy it.
For every observation, `performance.json` records a gate-generated run identity
and SHA-256-linked provenance covering the configured command name, executable
and rendered arguments, report path/source, fresh report bytes, test ID/status,
counter/value, and process status/exit code. Validation re-reads persisted
file, directory, and captured stdout reports and rejects missing or altered
reports, record mutation, configuration drift, duplicate counter sources,
non-passing tests, and results not produced by a successful configured command.
The signed performance head hashes stable semantic fields while the JSON retains
run/execution IDs, timestamps, report hashes, and chained provenance, so an
equivalent gate can be rerun after signing without invalidating the signature.
This provenance also gates CHANGE completeness and status freshness.
Native runner reports do not expose application operation counters, so projects
with such budgets must also configure an instrumented `musubix-json` report.
Native adapters and custom reports can coexist; only the instrumented report that
actually emits the named operation counter can prove the performance budget.

Mutation evidence uses a configured command with
`"mutationReport":{"format":"musubix-mutation-json","path":"..."}`. Each fresh
schema-v1 mutant record carries a deterministic `MUT-<hash>` identity (derivable
with the `mutationIdentity` helper exported from `musubix5/analysis`), must-functional requirement ID,
authoritative test ID, source/test paths and SHA-256 fingerprints, operator,
one-based line/column, and `killed|survived|skipped|error` status. The gate adds
command, rendered-argument, report, process, and exit provenance to
`mutation.json`. Supplied evidence must cover every must functional requirement
with a current linked killed mutant. Duplicate/conflicting, non-killed, stale,
unlinked, altered-report, and configuration-drift evidence is rejected.
`mutation.mode` defaults to `compatible` (absence is allowed); set it to
`strict` and protect it plus the mutation command in the policy baseline for
release. No mutation engine dependency is bundled. For Python, `mutation doctor`
recommends removing existing `__pycache__` directories before each run, then
using `python -B -m mutmut` and `python -B -m pytest` to avoid new bytecode. Mutation and model-correspondence
semantic heads are included in attestations and their underlying provenance is
revalidated.

Quality evidence records required flags, actual exits/output, metrics,
timestamps and input fingerprints. Changed-run paths, HEAD and impacts survive a
later full gate. `workflow-record` stores a self-reported Skill/phase/status and
optional command SHA-256 without storing command text. `workflow-verify` imports
only Skill invocation metadata from a Copilot JSONL log and binds every completed
declaration one-to-one, in order, to a distinct completed successful tool call.
Use `workflow-sanitize` first when the source transcript contains messages,
non-Skill tool arguments, or output that should not enter review evidence.
Each Skill invocation must therefore record exactly one final workflow outcome;
multi-phase chronology belongs in `change-record`, not duplicate workflow events.
Incomplete, failed, reused, out-of-order and stale bindings fail.
Set `"workflow":{"mode":"strict"}` or pass `--strict` to additionally require
valid JSON on every nonempty line, valid event timestamps, consistent one-to-one
tool start/completion lifecycles, and exactly one successful final terminal
state. Supported terminal formats are `result` with `exitCode: 0`, or the current
Copilot CLI lifecycle format with one session UUID and a final
`session.shutdown` whose `data.shutdownType` is `routine`. The shutdown format
also accepts one or more intermediate routine shutdowns when each is immediately
followed by `session.resume`; `workflow-sanitize` retains those lifecycle
boundaries. Mixed terminal formats, unmatched shutdown/resume transitions,
multiple session identities, abnormal shutdowns, and trailing events fail
closed. Compatible mode alone accepts more than one transcript path;
supplied files are concatenated in ascending order of each file's earliest
event timestamp (not command-line order), while each file's own internal
event order is preserved untouched — this lets declarations whose invocation
occurred in an earlier Copilot CLI session be reconciled by additionally
supplying that session's transcript file. A `toolCallId` that appears as a
tool start in more than one supplied file is rejected. Copilot CLI writes each
session's JSONL transcript to
`~/.copilot/session-state/<sessionId>/events.jsonl`; this path is an internal
detail of the installed Copilot CLI version, not a musubix5-owned contract, so
confirm it against your installed version rather than assuming it is stable
across releases.
The terminal `sessionId`, exit code, event count, terminal timestamp, raw source
hash and canonical transcript hash are persisted. `workflow.expectedSessionId`
or `--session-id` rejects substitution with a different caller-declared session.
Strict verification also bounds terminal transcript age and future clock skew
with `workflow.maxAgeSeconds` and `workflow.maxFutureSkewSeconds`.
Unrelated concurrent events—and even timestamps produced by different execution
clocks—may be non-monotonic, so strict mode uses JSONL source order for causal
tool/result lifecycles rather than imposing a timestamp sort. Pair/terminal clock
skew is enforced only when `maxEventSkewMs` is explicitly supplied; terminal age
and future-skew policies remain independently enforced. Verification remains
streaming and resource-bounded: transcripts default to 100,000,000 bytes, while
`workflow.maxTranscriptBytes` can explicitly raise the limit up to 1,000,000,000
bytes. Individual JSONL records default to 1,000,000 bytes and can be bounded up
to 10,000,000 with `workflow.maxTranscriptLineBytes`. Protect both chosen bounds
in the policy baseline so they cannot be widened silently.
If project inputs change while a gate is running, `input-stability` reports each
added, modified, or deleted path with before/after SHA-256 values. Standard
Cargo/Maven `target/`, manifest-scoped .NET `bin/` and `obj/`, and project-local
`.nuget/packages/` output are excluded, but source-like generated inputs remain fail-closed.
Write command-generated reports under `.musubix/evidence/native/` rather than the
tracked source tree, otherwise a command that writes its own report during the
gate invalidates input stability.
Built-in adapters own their targeting and report arguments. A
legacy leading Cargo/Go `test` subcommand is merged safely; conflicting report
flags such as `--json-report` are rejected.
Changes during a gate fail input stability; later source/config changes make
`status` stale. Attestations older than `maxAgeSeconds`, or issued farther in the
future than `maxFutureSkewSeconds`, fail. Local mode explicitly reports unsigned
evidence.

`ci-required` supports two deliberately distinct trust models:

- **Static trusted-key mode** (`githubOidc.mode: "off"`): `keyId` must select a
  configured Ed25519 public key. The signature covers repository, Git HEAD, CI
  provider/run ID, evidence heads, and the non-generated workspace snapshot.
- **GitHub OIDC strict mode**: configure `githubOidc.mode: "strict"` and a custom
  audience base. The verifier discovers GitHub's issuer metadata and JWKS,
  verifies the RS256 JWT, and checks issuer, bound audience, `exp`/`nbf`/`iat`,
  repository, commit `sha`, and `run_id`, plus optional `workflow` and `ref`.
  `keyBinding: "public-key"` authorizes an attestation-carried ephemeral
  Ed25519 public key by its SPKI SHA-256 in the custom audience.
  `keyBinding: "key-id"` instead adds OIDC authorization to a statically trusted
  key ID. If metadata/JWKS cannot be fetched, strict verification fails closed.

Evidence heads also bind stable non-attestation quality verdicts and formal
solver status, total requirements, modeled count/fraction, consistency, and
artifact identity. Excluding the attestation check from the quality head avoids
a circular signature dependency. A missing `ci-required` attestation is reported
as a failed/missing check, never as skipped local evidence.

#### Attestation evidence-head composition

`collectEvidenceHeads` (`packages/analysis/src/attestation.ts`) canonicalizes
up to ten independent evidence entries into stable per-entry digests. Each
entry's direct input/projection is:

- `tdd`: the last entry's `recordSha256` from `.musubix/evidence/tdd.json`'s
  hash chain — a chain-tip digest, not a projection over every recorded
  phase field.
- `workflow`: `workflowEvidenceHead`'s projection of
  `.musubix/evidence/workflow.json`'s `verification` block only
  (`eventsSha256`, `sourceSha256`, `transcriptSha256`, `mode`, `sessionId`,
  `exitCode`, `terminalAt`, `eventCount`, `sourceBytes`,
  `maxTranscriptBytes`, `maximumLineBytes`, `maxTranscriptLineBytes`, and
  `invocations` (each entry's `skill`/`toolCallId`/`invokedAt`/
  `completedAt`/`status`, unsorted/order-sensitive as stored), or just
  `eventsSha256`/`sourceSha256` when `mode`, `transcriptSha256`, and
  `sessionId` are all absent); the raw `events` log itself is excluded.
- `changes`: a canonical digest of `.musubix/evidence/changes.json`'s
  `changes` array directly — not the `.musubix/changes/*.md` documents
  themselves, which are a separate upstream input to that evidence.
- `order`: the last entry's `recordSha256` from `.musubix/evidence/order.json`'s
  records — a chain-tip digest, not a projection over every recorded
  declaration.
- `formal`: retains only `fingerprints`, `totalRequirements`,
  `modeledRequirements`, `modeledFraction`, and the solver's
  `artifact`/`status`/`result.consistency` from `.musubix/evidence/formal.json`,
  excluding `generatedAt` and every other `result` field such as solver
  duration, diagnostics, literals, and constraints.
- `performance`: `performanceEvidenceHead`'s projection of
  `.musubix/evidence/performance.json`, retaining per execution
  `commandName`/`commandSha256`/`reportPath`/`sourceKind`/`processStatus`/
  `exitCode`/a canonically-sorted `tests` array (each test entry kept in
  full), and per observation `requirementId`/`testId`/`counter`/`observed`/
  `maximum`/`status`/an optional `provenance` object retaining exactly
  `commandName`/`commandSha256`/`reportPath`/`sourceKind`/`testId`/
  `testStatus`/`counter`/`value`/`processStatus`/`exitCode`; both the
  `executions` and `observations` arrays are canonicalized
  order-independently.
- `mutation`: `mutationEvidenceHead`'s equivalent projection of
  `.musubix/evidence/mutation.json`, retaining per execution
  `commandName`/`commandSha256`/`reportPath`/`processStatus`/`exitCode`/a
  canonically-sorted `mutants` array (each mutant's full record); both the
  `executions` and nested `mutants` arrays are canonicalized
  order-independently.
- `modelCorrespondence`: `modelCorrespondenceEvidenceHead`'s projection of
  `.musubix/evidence/model-correspondence.json`, retaining `schemaVersion`,
  `formalEvidenceSha256`, `traceEvidenceSha256`, and a canonically-sorted
  `entries` array (each retaining `requirementId`/`requirementPath`/
  `formalSha256`/`modelSha256`/`traceSha256`/a canonically-sorted `tests`
  array retaining exactly `testId`/`testPath`/`testSha256`/`commandName`/
  `commandSha256`/`reportPath`, excluding `reportSha256`/`provenanceSha256`);
  any other stored run metadata is excluded.
- `quality`: retains `schemaVersion`, `mode`, a derived pass/fail `status`,
  and each non-`attestation` check's `name`/`required`/`status`/a narrow
  `diagnostics` projection (`code`/`severity`/`path`/`line`), plus `metrics`
  with the `attestation.errors` entry excluded; also excludes `generatedAt`,
  `durationMs`, and `stdout`/`stderr`.
- `workspace`: not an evidence file at all — a content digest over the
  non-evidence repository file set returned by `files(root)`, filtered by
  `evidenceInputPaths`; `.musubix/evidence/**` itself is excluded from this
  walk so writing evidence never perturbs the workspace snapshot it is
  bound into.

See `collectEvidenceHeads` and the per-entry head functions it delegates to
(`workflowEvidenceHead`, `performanceEvidenceHead`, `mutationEvidenceHead`,
`modelCorrespondenceEvidenceHead`) for the authoritative implementation; this
list is a summary, not a substitute for reading the source when precision
matters.

For normal CLI use, generate an Ed25519 key outside musubix5 and pass only its public PEM to
`attestation oidc-audience`, request the GitHub Actions OIDC token with that exact
audience, then pass the public PEM and JWT files to `attestation payload` and sign
the emitted payload externally. The `musubix5` CLI never accepts, reads, or stores
a private key. This repository's release-only automation separately generates an
ephemeral private key under the ignored `.test-work` directory, uses it for signing,
and deletes it before invoking CLI verification.
The short-lived JWT is included in the signed attestation and is intentionally
checked for current expiration, so verification must occur within its validity
window. This establishes that GitHub's OIDC identity authorized the signing key
and stated claims; it does not prove arbitrary runner behavior or the semantic
correctness of the workflow. The workflow evidence head separately binds
transcript/session fields into the Ed25519 signature.

## Formal methods, codegraph and retrieval limitations

- Deterministic formal checking works without external solvers. Controlled
  unconditional English/Japanese obligations retain the Boolean abstraction;
  strict `Formal:` JSON additionally models branch-scoped conditional truth,
  exact integer bounds with documented compatible units, intersected
  `afterMs`/`withinMs` response-delay intervals, and deterministic
  from-state/event targets. Arbitrary natural language, synonyms, scheduling,
  liveness, undocumented unit conversions, domain axioms and implementation
  behavior are not proven.
- `consistent` means the **modeled subset** is consistent; inspect `unsupported`.
  An empty subset reports `unknown` and exits nonzero. `valid` only indicates a
  nonempty modeled subset with no detected violation or requested execution error,
  **not** comprehensive proof. `none` skips solver
  execution; `auto` probes installed Z3 then Lean and tolerates missing tools.
  Explicit missing Z3/Lean, unknown, timeout or tool error returns nonzero.
- `formal generate` writes reproducible SMT-LIB2 and Lean inputs with SHA-256
  metadata without requiring either tool. `formal doctor` reports executable,
  version, timeout, missing and error states.
- Z3 receives actual QF_UFLIA SMT-LIB with named assertions and `check-sat`.
  Lean checks satisfiability or contradiction theorems over translated Boolean,
  integer, temporal, conditional-scenario and transition propositions. It is
  **not** a general SMT solver or proof of
  application correctness. `auto` also detects `lake env lean`. Use `--z3-command`,
  `--lean-command`, `MUSUBIX3_Z3`, or `MUSUBIX3_LEAN` for nonstandard paths.
  Generated inputs stay in the ignored cache.
- CI pins Lean through `lean-toolchain` and runs both native Z3 and Lean
  integrations, including consistent and inconsistent mixed models. Generated
  Lean satisfiability proofs provide explicit witnesses rather than searching
  Boolean assignments. Local installations may use another compatible version, but
  their exact version is retained in each solver report.
- The JS/TS compiler graph handles imports, re-exports, import-equals, literal
  `require`/dynamic imports, package manifest entrypoints, safe local URL/template
  cache-busting imports, and nearest `tsconfig.json` resolution. Calls are
  best-effort; symbol impact conservatively expands at **file** level. Nonliteral
  loading is a compatibility warning unless `codeGraph.mode` is `strict`, when
  it blocks graph gates; unresolved external packages remain warnings and
  unresolved local imports are errors. Bundler-specific resolution and
  reflection remain out of scope. Rust, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, C/C++,
  Objective-C/Objective-C++, C#, F#, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Dart,
  Scala, Elixir, Haskell, Lua, Zig, Solidity, R and Julia have conservative
  native adapters for local imports/modules/includes, declarations and direct
  calls. Other extensions are omitted from graph inputs. Ignored build/cache/dependency directories and
  symlinks are not indexed; custom `.gitignore` rules are not a scan filter.
- Remaining architectural work includes evidence-backed strict call-resolution
  ratio policy and broader native test-runner adapter coverage. Neither is
  enabled speculatively by this release.
- Trace annotation comment syntax is documented above. Do not create JS/TS proxy
  files for another language.
- Knowledge ranking is **TF-IDF/cosine, not GraphRAG** or semantic reasoning.
  Japanese uses character bigrams. Git co-change and author-directory counts
  cover at most 100 commits/30 files per commit; they indicate correlation and
  contribution, not causality or expertise. No Git history is explicitly skipped.
  Indexing is local; nothing is sent to a service.
- Core CI covers Node 22 on Linux, Windows, and macOS, with additional Node 20
  and Node 24 Linux compatibility checks. Native adapters and formal solvers run
  once on Linux with pinned toolchains.
  No formatting/lint framework is bundled; strict TypeScript and tests are used.

## Development and release checks

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
npm run pack:check
npm run pack:smoke
```

Workspaces: `packages/domain` (pure validators), `packages/analysis` (evidence,
compiler and filesystem services), `packages/cli` (thin command/installation layer).
One build emits `dist/packages/**`. Published contents explicitly include hidden
skills, native manifests, built CLI/modules and assets. Core CI runs on Node 22
across Linux, Windows, and macOS, with additional Node 20 and Node 24 compatibility
checks on Linux. Native adapter and formal-solver integrations run on Linux with
pinned toolchains. Tests cover unit behavior, CLI exits, installer preservation,
and packaging.
`pack:smoke` installs the real tarball into an isolated `.test-work/` consumer,
checks its executable, ESM exports and installer, then removes the fixture.
Attestation APIs are available from both `musubix5/analysis` and the focused
`musubix5/attestation` export.

Tags matching `v*` run `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow requires
the tag to equal `v` plus the package/plugin versions, runs the full Linux
native/formal suite, performs two clean reproducible pack cycles, and creates a
sealed npm tarball, CycloneDX `npm sbom`, and SHA256SUMS. A tag-push run performs
validation and artifact production only: it never publishes npm or creates a
GitHub Release. Those side effects require a separate manual dispatch from the
same lightweight tag, a descendant full-SHA evidence commit, and independently
authorized `release` and/or `publish` operation IDs. The release and publish
jobs are independent. The publish job uses the protected `npm-publish`
environment; Trusted Publishing runs `npm publish --access public`, while the
optional token fallback runs `npm publish --provenance --access public`.
The repository administrator must create and configure that protected
environment, including its required reviewers and deployment restrictions,
and verify it before any manual release dispatch. The workflow declaration
does not create the environment, and publication cannot proceed safely until
this prerequisite exists.

The release attestation uses a real GitHub Actions OIDC token whose custom
audience binds an ephemeral Ed25519 public key. Its signature covers repository,
tagged candidate, run ID, workflow/ref identity, release context (including the
evidence commit and independently derived approval on dispatch), and SHA256SUMS.
Each side-effect job verifies those bindings and GitHub's live issuer/JWKS before
acting. The ephemeral private key is deleted before the run-scoped bundle is
uploaded.
